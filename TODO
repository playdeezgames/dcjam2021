To Complete Required Features for Jam:
  ✔ "Essentially modeless" with a fixed 3D perspective. @done(21-03-31 18:57)
    (The game must have first-person exploration at all times. Exceptions are point to point overworld map movement (fast travel), combat screens or town screens.)
  ✔ An initially unknown explorable map. (i.e. a map of the dungeon level) @done(21-04-01 05:53)
    (The game must have explorable locations. It doesn't have to be a dungeon in the traditional sense. It can be urban environments, outdoors, spaceship interiors, planetary surfaces etc. Whichever environment the game has it must be viewed and explored in first-person.)
  ✔ Entities occupy the entire tile, and only one tile at a time. @done(21-04-01 05:53)
    (The game must have instant step movement on a grid. Smooth transition between grid squares is allowed. Half-steps or dividing the square into smaller squares is not accepted.)
  ✔ The grid is 2D/3D made from squares/cubes. @done(21-03-31 19:33)
    (The game must have 90 degree turns in the cardinal directions, North, East, South, West. Smooth transition between 90 degree angles is allowed. Mouse-look is also allowed. Games which let you turn 90 degrees up and down are also allowed.)
  ✔ First Person POV. @done(21-03-31 19:34)
    (The game must have a player controlled character (or party of characters), or the abstraction of a character or persona.)
  ✔ Resource management and vital statistics. @done(21-04-02 04:43)
    (The game must at the very least have some basic stats. (Minimum a single health/power bar))

    (The game must have a death/perish condition, or some other end-of-game mechanic.)
  ✔ A way of replenishing resources and vital statistics. @done(21-04-03 04:40)
    (The game must have at least one way to affect character stat(s). Examples are resting, potions, items with bonuses, food, water, powerups etc.)
